TODO
====

# Move classes into modules (materials, bodies/hittables, cameras)
# Fix moving sphere's center function (it can't take arguments other then time=time0..time1)
# Comply with Google C++ Code Style
# Make moving elements as wrappers, pretending to be bodies
# Create query interface for bodies - are they close? do they intersect? distance between them?
